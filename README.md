D3 Homework - Data Journalism and D3

This project uses D3.js to visualize some state-level data about population health based on 2014 U.S. Census data.  It similates an on-line newpaper article with an interactive visualization.  One risk factor (smoking rate) is plotted against two perhaps underlying factors (income and age).
